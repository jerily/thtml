# Simple blog example using twebserver and thtml

[thtml](https://github.com/jerily/thtml) is web server agnostic.
However, this example is based on [twebserver](https://github.com/jerily/twebserver)
and you have to have it installed in order to run this example.

To run the example:
```bash
tclsh8.6 app.tcl
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
